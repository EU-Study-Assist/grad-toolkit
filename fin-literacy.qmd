# Financial Literacy

## Budgeting Basics for Graduates
1. **Track Your Income and Expenses**

    - Use budgeting apps like Intuit Mint, YNAB (You Need a Budget), or a simple spreadsheet to monitor spending.

2. **Follow the 50/30/20 Rule**

    - Allocate 50% of your income to necessities (rent, utilities, food).
    - Use 30% for discretionary spending (entertainment, hobbies).
    - Save or invest 20% for future goals and emergencies.
    - The above is not written on stone, you can switch things around based on your reality

3. **Set Financial Goals**

    - Short-term: Save for a vacation or an emergency fund.
    - Long-term: Plan for retirement or buying a home.

4. **Avoid Impulse Purchases**

    - Delay non-essential purchases for at least 24 hours before deciding.

## Understanding Loans and Debt Management
1. **Types of Loans**

    - Student Loans: Know the interest rate, repayment terms, and deferment options.
    - Personal Loans: Often used for emergencies or significant purchases but come with higher interest rates.

2. **Create a Repayment Plan**

    - Pay more than the minimum to reduce interest costs.
    - Use methods like the **Avalanche Method** (focus on high-interest loans first) or **Snowball Method** (pay off smaller debts first).

3. **Negotiate Terms**

    - Contact lenders to discuss lowering interest rates or adjusting payment schedules if needed.

4. **Avoid High-Interest Debt**

    - Be cautious with credit cards; aim to pay the full balance monthly.

    - **High-Risk**: Individual stocks, cryptocurrencies.

4. **Leverage Employer Benefits**

    - Contribute to retirement accounts like 401(k) or pension plans, especially if your employer matches contributions. If you are in other parts of the world where this is not applicable, you can search for what’s possible in that region


## Taxes: What You Need to Know
1. **Understand Your Tax Obligations**
