# Career Planning

## Setting Career Goals
Setting clear and actionable career goals is the first step in building a successful career. Follow these steps to define your goals:

1. **Reflect on Your Aspirations**

    - What inspires you?
    - Where do you see yourself in 5 or 10 years?
    - What type of work makes you feel fulfilled?

2. **Use the SMART Framework**

    - Ensure your goals are **Specific**, **Measurable**, *Achievable**, **Relevant**, and **Time-bound**. Example: "Secure a data analyst position at a tech company within six months."

3. **Break Down Goals**
Divide your long-term goals into short-term objectives.

    - Long-term: Become a project manager in the next 5 years.
    - Short-term: Gain certifications in project management and complete internships.


## Exploring Career Paths
Discovering the right career path involves research, self-assessment, and exploration:

1. **Research Industries and Roles**

    - What industries align with your degree and interests?
    - Explore roles within those industries using platforms like LinkedIn, Glassdoor, and career blogs.

2. **Try Job Shadowing or Internships**

    - Gain hands-on experience by working with professionals in fields you're curious about.

3. **Seek Guidance from Mentors**
    
    - Talk to alumni, professors, or professionals to gain insight into potential career trajectories.
